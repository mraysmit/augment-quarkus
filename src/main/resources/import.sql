-- Sample data for development and testing
-- This file is automatically executed when Hibernate creates the schema

-- Note: The ApplicationLifecycle class will handle data initialization
-- This file is kept minimal to avoid conflicts with the lifecycle initialization

-- Additional static reference data could be added here if needed
-- For example: currency codes, instrument types, etc.
